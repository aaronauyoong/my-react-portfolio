					<p>
						My name is Aaron Au Yoong, and I am starting my journey as a website
						and software developer. After various experiences over the past 2
						years, I have emerged as a fresh web developer after earning a
						certificate in full-stack web development from Monash University. I
						have developed technical skills and languages that cover front-end
						and back-end development, which include JavaScript, Node JS, React
						JS, MongoDB and SQL. 

						<br/>
						<br/>
						
						I am a keen learner and am looking to work with
						fellow developers to build impactful technologies. As a Masterâ€™s
						graduate with a year of full-time experience in the IT industry, I
						have developed soft skills that include critical thinking,
						communication and teamwork. 

						<br/>
						<br/>
						
						I aim to further understand people,
						relationships, interactions and the technological applications that
						can be used to enhance work-life satisfaction, efficiency and
						productivity through the combination of studying a Bachelor of
						Science (Psych), Masters of Business Information Technology and a
						Full Stack Web Development Diploma.
